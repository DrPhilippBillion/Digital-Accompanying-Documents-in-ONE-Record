# Digital-Accompanying-Documents-in-ONE-Record

## Basics

### Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to provide a Good Practice for using Digital Accompanying documents in an IATA ONE Record-based data eco-system

### Creators
This document is the outcome of a ONE Record pilot project with the "Digitales Testfeld Air Cargo" by the German air cargo community.

Parties/Persons involved were:

Lufthansa Cargo, Philipp Billion (in lead)




## Assumptions
One or more stakeholders are able to provide digital accompanying documents


## Process

### Solution approach

Digital accompanying documents are based on the use of the ONE Record data object 

>ExternalReference

The ExternalReference can be attached to any data object, as a digital accompanying document can relate to any data object. E.g. this can be a ULD certificate linked with a ULD LO, documents releated with the pieces under one contract (= Shipment LO), an external reference can be added to the Shipment LO. Many documents will be bound 

The use of the ExternalReference for Photos, Videos, etc. will be exactly identical to the use for PDFs as described here. Thus in terms of ONE Record, the mechanisms would be completely identical

### Target process

### Solution in current environment

In the legacy messaging environment, digital accompanying documents are not possible. Generic solutions with generic cloud environments are possible, but not accoding to any standards and thus not scalable.

## Data fields

### General data fields

### Basic API-Features used

## Additional comments

### Provision of BLOBs on the data provider side

### Procession of BLOBs on the data user side
